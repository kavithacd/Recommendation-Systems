# Recommendation-Systems
Online E-commerce websites like Amazon, Flipkart uses different recommendation models to provide different suggestions to different users. Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.  Objective: Build a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products.
